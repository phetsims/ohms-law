# Ohm's Law model

This document describes the model for the Ohm's Law simulation.<br>

The model represents the current of a circuit.

The Formula is I= V/R or Current = Volts / Ohms

`I` is the current through the conductor in units of amperes, `V` is the voltage measured across the conductor in units
of volts, and `R` is the resistance of the conductor in units of ohms. More specifically, Ohm's law states that the R in
this relation is constant, independent of the current. This simulation's model is simple. It represents this formula.
